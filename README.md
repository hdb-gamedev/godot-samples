## simple-player-controller
Basic example--use this as a base to create a player controller.

The environment is already set up:
- Tilemap using [Kenny Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer)
- Player animations `idle` by default, and `walk` available to switch to
- Input map with `move_left` `move_right` and `jump`
